# Food-Tracker
An app for tracking the food I have in my fridge so I can buy what I need when restocking.

This is a system for keeping track of what food I have in my fridge. When shopping, I sometimes buy too much of a certain food type (for example buying an extra pack of vegetables) so having a way to know exactly what I need to complete any meals I’ve already bought some food for is a useful idea for me. It should be able to tell me how many full meals I have and leftovers after discounting the full meals so I’m buying the right things to complete the meals. I am not particularly competent at python e.g. I had to look up if it was object oriented to make the plan, so a lot of the skills I am learning through this are basically getting to grips with the language. Furthermore, my plan will mostly be a basis for things I can add later to show off skills I learn in class, hence I will endeavour to be flexible with changing the layout for something better or adding new features etc. One of the main skills I aim to show at this stage is that I can build a pipeline for the processing of data, which should already be apparent to some extent in my plan. The skill I am hoping to develop the most is my time management. Making sure a notable change can be seen week to week according to my plan should give me the motivation I need to do steady work on the project.
